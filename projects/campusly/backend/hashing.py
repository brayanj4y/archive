    A utility class for securely hashing and verifying passwords using bcrypt.

    - Generate secure bcrypt hashes from plain-text passwords.
    - Verify that a provided plain-text password matches a stored bcrypt hash.

    All methods are static, meaning they can be called without creating an instance of the class.
